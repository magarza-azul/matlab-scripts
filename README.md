# matlab-scripts

This is a repository to host all the MATLAB scripts I've developed while
working with data at my current job, as well as other scripts I've created 
for small projects of my own. It's also a way to keep track of all the changes 
and improvements of these scripts. 

Projects to date:

1. Scripts to import, organize and plot data from marine buoy of Gando (Gran Canaria).
2. Scripts to import, organize and plot data from Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) Jona Sophie.
3. Script to create APA bibliography.
